# fiberphotometry

This repository contains preprocessing, analysis, and visualization code for fiber photometry recordings during a temporal wagering task. The recordings are fiber photometry measurements of an optical sensor (GRAB), aligned to behavioral events across multiple reward and block conditions.

This repo supports:
- Extraction of average fluorescence signals aligned to task events
- Condition-specific comparisons of dopamine and acetylcholine signals (reward volume, delay, side)
- Reproduction of key photometry figures from the paper Jang et al. bioRxiv (2024)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository and also the utils_core repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heejaeyunajang/fiberphotometry.git
git clone https://github.com/heejaeyunajang/utils_core.git
```

### 2. Add folders to your MATLAB path
```matlab
addpath(genpath('fiberphotometry/src'))
addpath(genpath('utils_core'))
```

### 3. Run the main script
main_fiberphotometry
